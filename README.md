# Retail Segmentation

This repository contains Python code for performing customer segmentation analysis on retail transaction data using K-means clustering.

## Description

The code preprocesses the data, including cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization. It then applies the K-means algorithm to cluster customers based on their purchasing behavior. The analysis provides insights into distinct customer segments, facilitating targeted marketing strategies for improved business outcomes in the retail sector.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Place the `retail-churn.csv` file in the repository root directory.
4. Open and run the `customer_segmentation.ipynb` notebook in a Python environment.

## Repository Structure

- `customer_segmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code.
- `retail-churn.csv`: Sample retail transaction data.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries.
